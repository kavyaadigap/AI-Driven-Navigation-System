# AI-Driven Autonomous Spacecraft Navigation & Space Debris Avoidance üöÄ

This project simulates an **AI-driven autonomous spacecraft navigation system** that avoids **space debris** while navigating through space. The spacecraft starts at a predefined position and navigates toward a target destination, using a reactive AI algorithm to avoid collisions with space debris.

## Overview üåå

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI-inspired algorithms can be used for **autonomous navigation** in space. The spacecraft must navigate through a field of space debris (defunct satellites, rocket bodies, and fragments) to reach its destination safely. The system combines:
- A **desired direction** (toward the destination).
- An **avoidance vector** (away from debris).

The simulation is visualized in **3D** using Plotly, and the entire application is built with **Streamlit** for an interactive user experience.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Realistic Space Debris Data**: Uses real-world space debris data to simulate obstacles.
- **AI-Driven Navigation**: Combines desired direction and avoidance vectors for smooth navigation.
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D plot to visualize the spacecraft's trajectory, debris, and destination.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust simulation parameters like speed, safe margin, and weight for desired direction vs. avoidance.

## Technologies Used üíª

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and vector math.
- **Pandas**: For processing and analyzing the space debris dataset.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Plotly**: For creating 3D visualizations of the simulation.
- **Git**: For version control.

## Dataset üìä

The project uses a dataset containing information about space debris, including:
- `OBJECT_NAME`: Name of the debris object.
- `MEAN_MOTION`: Mean motion of the object (revolutions per day).
- `INCLINATION`: Orbital inclination (degrees).
- `RA_OF_ASC_NODE`: Right ascension of the ascending node (degrees).
- `X`, `Y`, `Z`: Randomly generated positions for the debris in 3D space.
- `Radius`: Randomly generated size of the debris.

The dataset is stored in a CSV file (`space_debris.csv`), which is processed and used to simulate obstacles in the 3D environment.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - The spacecraft calculates an **avoidance vector** based on the positions and sizes of nearby debris.
   - The avoidance vector uses a **repulsion force** (`1 / dist^3`) to steer the spacecraft away from debris.

2. **Combined Direction**:
   - The spacecraft combines the **desired direction** (toward the destination) and the **avoidance vector** using a weighted sum.
   - A small random perturbation is added to prevent the spacecraft from getting stuck.

3. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The spacecraft moves step-by-step, updating its position based on the combined direction and speed.
   - The simulation stops when the spacecraft reaches the destination or exceeds the maximum number of steps.

4. **Visualization**:
   - The spacecraft's trajectory, debris, and destination are visualized in 3D using Plotly.
